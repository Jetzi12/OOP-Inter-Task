# OOP-Inter-Task
The task was about creating abstract structure of OOP model. Topic was a trees. 
As an solution, author created abstract class Plant, interface Tree and two 
classes of trees species. 
Class Plant have two methods:
    public Long fotosythesis(Long quantityOfSunEnergy, Long numberOfCO2)
and
   public void shedLeaves(Long numberOfLeaves).

Interface is declaring three abstract methods 
    public void growUp()

Two classes, which implements Tree and extends Plant, are ConiferousTree
and DeciduousTree. Examples of overriding and overloading methods are shown 
in codes of these classes.
