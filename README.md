# OOP-Inter-Task
The task was about creating an abstract structure of the OOP model. The topic was a tree. 
As a solution, the author created abstract class Plant, interface Tree, and two 
classes of trees species. 
Class Plant has two methods:
    public Long photosynthesis(Long quantityOfSunEnergy, Long numberOfCO2)
and
   public void shedLeaves(Long numberOfLeaves).

Interface is declaring three abstract methods 
    public void growUp()
    public void increaseRoots()
    public void createNewRoots()

Two classes, which implement Tree and extends Plant, are ConiferousTree
and DeciduousTree. Examples of overriding and overloading methods are shown 
in the codes of these classes.
